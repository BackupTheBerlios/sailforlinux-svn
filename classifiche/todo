[To finish]


[Version 1.0]
- add a legenda to the exports
- consider the discard, if present
- in the regatta ranking, consider the eventuality that two or more skipper have the same points: the method to 
  resolve this can be:
  * consider another discard until the problem is solved
  * add a race with only these skipper (that must not be considered for the others)
- add the possibility to change the configuration options with a gui (with qtableview)
- redesign the legenda
- the sorting must consider the value of the total colum as integer


[Some time after 1.0]
- add the regatta info (something like metadata)
- The data file of the ranking (regatta and general) must be indipendent from
the name of the file. A possibility is to add a metainfo to the file with the name of
the regatta and/or classes. The problem is that in this way, when I load a file, 
I must scan all the files to determine which is correct, also if I am using a different 
extension for the detailed ranking and the general ranking.
