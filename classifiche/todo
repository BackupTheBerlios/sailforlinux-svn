[To finish]


[Version 1.0]
- translation
- add the validation of the input (points must be a number, skipper must be different)
- add a legenda to the exports
- consider the discard, if present
- in the regatta ranking, consider the eventuality that two or more skipper have the same points: the method to 
  resolve this can be:
  * consider another discard until the problem is solved
  * add a race with only these skipper (that must not be considered for the others)
- add the possibility to change the configuration options with a gui (with qtableview)
- when a result is modified, the program must ask to save or forget the change.
- when a regatta ranking is saved, the general ranking must be updated, according with the
  class
- redesign the legenda
- the sorting must consider the value of the total colum as integer
- add the regatta info (something like metadata)
