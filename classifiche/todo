[To finish]
- How I build the class ranking data ? 
- To accomplish the item above, there is a need to convert the file format of the data to a 
  ConfigParser object. This way it is possible to add also the metadata


[Version 1.0]
- translation
- add the validation of the input (points must be a number, skipper must be different)
- add a legenda to the exports
- consider the discard, if present
- in the regatta ranking, consider the eventuality that two or more skipper have the same points: the method to 
  resolve this can be:
  * consider another discard until the problem is solved
  * add a race with only these skipper (that must not be considered for the others)
- add the possibility to change the configuration options with a gui (with qtableview)
- when a result is modified, the program must ask to save or forget the change.
- when a regatta ranking is saved, the general ranking must be updated, according with the
  class
- redesign the legenda
- the sorting must consider the value of the total colum as integer
- consider the mathrace ranking


[Some time after 1.0]
- add the regatta info (something like metadata)
- The data file of the ranking (regatta and general) must be indipendent from
the name of the file. A possibility is to add a metainfo to the file with the name of
the regatta and/or classes. The problem is that in this way, when I load a file, 
I must scan all the files to determine which is correct, also if I am using a different 
extension for the detailed ranking and the general ranking.
