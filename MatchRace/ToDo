[To finish]
- input validation


[Version 1]

- add the data directory for output
- improve the status bar usage

  in this case there can be these solutions:
  * add a single run (and relative ranking) with two or more skippers
  * consider only the direct match between the skippers
 
[Version 2]
- add the delete button for the skipper
